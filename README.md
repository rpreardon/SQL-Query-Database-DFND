# SQL-Query-Database-DFND
- This is a project from Data Foundations Nanodegree from Udacity
- The idea behind this project was to utilize SQL to query relational database to find insights you find interesting
- You'll need:
  - SQLLite
  - The database used is called chinook provided by Udacity; I believe this is available on kaggle
  
##### This is a fun project to learn SQL and to do some basic queries
